The variable HHID will be on all files.  Each respondent is assigned
an unique value of HHID.  It can be used to merge data from one file
with data from another file.

     Minimum Value: 1,001
     Maximum Value: 8,111

NWEIGHT 'The Final Weight'                                  Columns 6-11

The sample design for RECS is not a simple random sample. Consequently,
to estimate the number or percent of households/housing units with a
certain characteristic, the sampling weight should be used.  The
variable NWEIGHT is the sampling weight for the observation.  It is
approximately the inverse of the probability of selection.  It gives
the number of households that the response represents in the sample. 
For most categorical variables, the codebooks contain both the
unweighted frequency and the weighted frequency.  The unweighted
frequency gives the number of observations, the weighted frequency
gives survey estimate of the number of households/housing units for
each possible value of the variable.  The weighted frequencies are
rounded to the nearest 100,000 households.  This is the limit of the
accuracy for RECS.  When the unweighted frequency is less than 10 or
the weighted frequency is less than 150,000; then weighted frequency is
suppressed.  A 'Q' is placed in the frequency to denote that the number
is suppressed.  This indicates that there are too few observation upon
which to determine an accurate estimate.

When QMAIL equals 1, the household and housing unit data was
not obtained via a personal interview.  The data were obtained using a
shortened mail questionnaire.  A hot-deck imputation procedure was used
to match each mail respondent to a personal interview respondent.  The
critical matching variables were FUELHEAT, FUELH2O, TYPECOOL, TYPEHUQ,
and REGIONC.  Additional variables used in a scoring function to
determine the best match were MONEYPY, NHSLDMEM, VEHICLES, HHAGE, and
TOTROOMS.  The remaining household/housing unit characteristics for the
mail respondents were determined by the values of the matched personal
interview respondent.  The energy consumption and expenditures data for
the mail respondents was based upon data obtained from their energy
suppliers.  It was not imputed using a hot deck procedure.

Questionnaire data from personal interview respondents sometime is
missing and needs to be imputed.  'Z' variables are used to indicate
the presence of imputed data.  For example, if ZURBRUR = 0 then URBRUR
was not imputed.  If ZURBRUR = 1 then URBRUR was imputed.

Cooling degree days are the number of degrees the average daily
temperature (ADT) is above the base temperature.  Heating degree days
are the number of degrees the ADT is below the base temperature.  To
calculate daily degree days (base 65 degrees):

          ADT = (daily high + daily low)/2

          CDD(daily)     = 0            if ADT <= 65
                         = ADT - 65     if ADT > 65

          HDD(daily)     = 0            if ADT >= 65
                         = 65 - ADT     if ADT < 65.

Annual degrees days are calculated by summing the daily degree days. 
The .5 is carried over in the summation.  The total is rounded up after
the summation.

     The variable ORIGLPC On file 10 summarizes the source of the data for
     DOLLARLP.

     The variable USELP on File 6 can be used to determine if a household
     uses kerosene.

     The 25 cases where USELP equals 1 and DOLLARLP equals 0 occurs when 
     the household uses LPG but did not report buying LPG in the 12 months prior
     to the interview or the supplier reported that they did not deliver LPG
     to the household during 1993.

   
The remaining variables are estimates of expenditures by end use.  

For each household that responded to the 1993 RECS, the annual energy
expenditures for five end-use categories-- space heating, water heating, air-
conditioning, refrigerators, and general appliance usage--were estimated. 
The end-use estimates were produced for each of the five main energy sources:
electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, kerosene, and liquefied petroleum gas
(LPG).  The end-use expenditures were not based on data produced by placing
meters on individual appliances; rather, they were obtained by estimating how
much of the total annual expenditures for each energy source can be
attributed to each of the end-use categories for each household by using a
regression technique.  

The regression technique was used to first estimate the percent of energy
consumption by energy source and end use.  Next these percents were used to
determine the corresponding amount spent on each end-use by each household.  

The end-use estimates were normalized so that the sum of the end-use
estimates was equal to the actual or imputed yearly expenditures for each
energy source used by the household.

In particular:
     DOLLAREL  = DOLELSPH + DOLELWTH + DOLELAPL + DOLELCOL + DOLELRFG
     DOLLARNG  = DOLNGSPH + DOLNGWTH + DOLNGAPL + DOLNGCOL
     DOLLARFO  = DOLFOSPH + DOLFOWTH + DOLFOAPL
     DOLLARLP  = DOLLPSPH + DOLLPWTH + DOLLPAPL
     DOLLARKR  = DOLKRSPH + DOLKRWTH + DOLKRAPL

For all energy sources, the space-heating component was defined as all energy
used to generate heat by space-heating equipment.  The equipment could be the
main space-heating equipment or secondary space-heating equipment.  Hence,
for all energy sources, a household could have had a positive amount of
energy assigned to the space-heating component even if the energy source was
not used as the main space-heating energy source.

The component for water heating was defined as all energy used to heat water
for hot running water, as well as water heated at point sources (such as
stoves or auxiliary water-heating equipment) for bathing, cleaning and other
noncooking applications of hot water.  Energy used at point sources to heat
water for cooking and hot drinks was considered part of the general appliance
component, as was energy used to heat water for a swimming pool, hot tub,
spa, or Jacuzzi. 

For electricity, end use estimates were also made for freezers, cooking,
dishwashers, and clothes dryers.  The estimates are DOLELFRZ, DOLELCOK,
DOLELDWH, and DOLELCDR.  DOLELAPL also includes these end uses, hence
DOLELAPL equals the sum of DOLELFRZ, DOLELCOK, DOLELDWH, and DOLELCDR plus
the expenditures for lights and other numerous appliances.  The electricity
used in refrigerators is not included in DOLELAPL.  DOLELAPL includes all
electricity expenditures except electricity use for space heating, water
heating, air conditioning, and refrigerators.  This includes electricity used
for freezers, cooking, dishwashers, clothes dryers, lights, TV's, VCR's,
stereos, coffee makers, power tools, pool heaters, furnace fans, home
computers, and many more uses.

     For the 1993 and subsequent RECS, the electricity regression equation
     assigned the electricity associated with the operation of fans in any
     central forced-air heating equipment was assigned to the electricity
     appliance component and not to the space-heating component.  Hence, if
     ELWARM = 0 then DOLELSPH = 0.

     There was 1 case where ELWARM = 1 and DOLELSPH = 0.  The respondent 
     claimed electricity was their main space-heating fuel.

     The 147 cases where AIRCOND = 1 yet DOLELCOL = 0 correspond to cases
     where the household has air-conditioning equipment but reported that the
     equipment was not used.                                  

     The electricity air-conditioning component was defined as all
     electricity associated with (1) electric air-conditioning equipment and
     (2) fans in any central air-conditioning equipment including natural gas
     air-conditioning equipment.  The regression equations for electricity do
     not contain specific terms for whole-house fans, window fans, and
     evaporative (swamp) coolers.  Hence, the electricity expenditures to
     operate these fans and evaporative coolers was not assigned to the air-
     conditioning component; it was included in the appliance component.
     There is a term for ceiling fans in the electricity appliance component.

     In the 1993 RECS, the households that reported that they had
     air-conditioning equipment but did not use the equipment, were assigned
     a value of zero for their electricity air-conditioning component.  In
     RECS prior to 1987, these households were assigned small but positive
     values for their electricity air-conditioning component.

     The 8 cases where DOLNGCOL was positive correspond to cases where the
     household claimed that the fuel for the central air-conditioning system
     was natural gas and no conflicting information was discovered during the
     editing process.

     In order for DOLELCOK to be positive, the household had to have an
     electric stove or oven (STOVENA = 5, or STOVEA = 5, or OVENA = 5)or the
     main cooking fuel had to be electricity (FUELFOOD = 5).  In addition,
     the household had to report that they cook hot meals at least once a
     week or more (NUMMEAL equals 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) or the households had to
     report that they used their electric oven once a day or more (OVENUSE =
     1 or 2).
